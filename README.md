#quickSortVisualizer

    In this project I implemented the quick sort algorithm to sort an
array and print itself to the terminal so you can see the progress.  As
the pointers pass valid numbers for their side they will turn green, if a
number that needs to be swapped is encountered it will turn red, and any
value thatequals the pivot will be shown in yellow.  When the array is
partitionedfor the next recursive call, any elements outside of the
current range will be greyedout so you can tell where you are in the
sorting process.
